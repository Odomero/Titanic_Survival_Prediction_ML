# Titanic_Survival_Prediction_ML
The project predicts the survival rate of passengers on the Titanic using the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

The following ML models were built and evaluated using Accuracy Score from sklearn.
	Models	                  Accuracy_Score
GradientBoostingClassifier	0.824,
RandomForestClassifier	    0.803,
LogisticRegression	        0.797,
DecisionTree	              0.790,
LinearSVM	                  0.780,
GaussianNB	                0.742,
KNearestNeighbors         	0.719,
rbfSVM	                    0.702,

### Conclusion
* Exploratory Data Analysis revealed a higher survival rate of females and passengers who boarded with Pclass 1.
* The model evaluation revealed the best model to be the GradientBoostingClassifier model with an accuracy score of 82.4%
